# Casady & Greene Fonts

A collection of typefaces by font foundry and software company Casady & Greene.

With [Typoasis's page on Casady & Greene](https://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/index.htm)
becoming unavailable, I created this repository as another archive for these fonts.

All WOFF2 fonts are unofficially derived from the TTF font files.

## License

According to a former Casady & Greene designer Mike Wright, "I believe that all the fonts
that were developed by the company are now in the public domain."

As the company closed on July 3, 2003, I believe the use of these fonts is fine, but I
may avoid them for commercial products. If anyone is more knowledgable about this topic,
please feel free to reach out!
