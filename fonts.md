## Statements

> Many of the Casady & Greene, Inc. fonts were owned by Casady & Greene, Inc. No one claimed them at the dissolution of the company, so I guess they are in the public domain. I don't really know for certain.
>
> The rights to some of them were owned by their creators. I created: Kells, Meath, Dorovar Carolus, Gregorian, Gazelle, Jott, and KeyCaps. I have put them into the public domain.
>
> Mike Wright (programmer and owner of iData) owns: Abilene, Desperado, Dry Gulch, Pendragon, Black Knight, Paladin, Slender Gold, and Vremya (Slovic languages). Mike has put his fonts in the public domain.
>
> Karen L. Cohen created: Kasse, Highland Gothic, Cut Outs, Michelle, Fletcher Gothic, Rocko, and Fattipatti. I don't know the status of her fonts.
